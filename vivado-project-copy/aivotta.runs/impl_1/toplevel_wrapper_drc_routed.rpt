The RAMB36E1 toplevel_i/tta_core_toplevel_0/U0/onchip_mem_INSTR/RAM_ARR_reg_0_0 has an input control pin toplevel_i/tta_core_toplevel_0/U0/onchip_mem_INSTR/RAM_ARR_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: toplevel_i/tta_core_toplevel_0/U0/onchip_mem_INSTR/ADDRARDADDR[12]) which is driven by a register (toplevel_i/tta_core_toplevel_0/U0/core/fu_DMA/read_cmd_in_valid_r_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
